Hello and welcome to my page of Python projects!
I currently have two python projects in this repository.
The first one, which I built with my group members in my Scripting for Data Analysis course, is a high level analysis of Tesla and Dogecoin stock trends compared side by side with Elon Musk's tweets across time. This was an awesome project in which I was able to build a binary classifier model using SVM, XGBoost Classifier, and logistic regression to determine whether or not to buy stock given historical data inputs. In addition to this, I used Meta Prophet to build a trendline for future stock data. There is so much more analysis that we worked on in this project so I encourage you to take a look!
The second project is a hotel review data munging project of data scraped from trip advisor and booking.com. Web Scraping is oftentimes followed by an intense and timely process of data cleaning and wrangling - dealing with NAs, unnecessary characters, and poorly formatted data. This was a great project to apply functions across columns and get the data into a workable format for data analysis.
